### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in political science at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on the intersection of political violence and rhetoric/narrative. I've studied extremist messaging, the online popularization of certain terrorist tactics, and how public opinion constrains and enables insurgents. Methodologically, my main interests lie in archival and computational approaches.
